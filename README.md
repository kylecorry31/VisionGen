# VisionGen
A Python script which generates Java code for the Robot Vision API to help teams get started with simple vision tracking.

**Future:** Build a GUI for this.

## Installation
Install the following dependencies:
- python3

Then clone this repository.

## Usage
To use this script, run the following command from the source directory. Where ClassName is the name of the Java file/class. Answer the questions asked by the script to set the vision parameters.

`python3 visiongen.py ClassName`


This will generate a file called `ClassName.java` in the same directory which contains the vision code needed for FRC.
